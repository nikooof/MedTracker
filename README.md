# MedTracker

## The Application's purpose

As someone who consumes three different types of drugs, three times a day, I often forget to replenish my medicines when they are almost out.
This issue is worsened because I take different drugs every alternating day, as I have more drugs to take care of. This leads to me sometimes storing drugs that are expired and not replenish drugs that are almost finished.

This application aims to solve this issue by keeping a record of all the drugs available to a person and display information such as _how much left_, which for a tablet-type medicine would refer to _how many tablets left before I run out_.

It will also be able to tell the user which drugs are finished, almost finished while also letting them observe all the medicines in their arsenal.

## Target Audience

This application is created for people like who take many drugs and have a difficult time keeping track of their expiring date, etc.
